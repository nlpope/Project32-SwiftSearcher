 PROBLEM TRACKING:
 * = problem
 >  = solution
 
 * (NOTE: METHOD NO LONGER EXISTS, BUT STILL RELEVANT) Persistence Mgr. > updateProjectsWith() - having trouble understanding closure syntax in persistence mgr funcs
 > I get it - the SSError? in the below sig is referring to the parameter you'll play with in the '{' after calling 'updateProjectsWith...'
 > .. so yes, it's what you'll play with (the parameter[s]) once it's done - where i was getting stumped is in thinking that (SSError?) -> Void referred to what saveProjects() had to be,
 > .. but think of it instead as saveProjects() spitting out the parameter you'll be playing with (SSError?) when 'updatProjectsWith...' is done - see below:
 
 COMPLETIONHANDLER IN SIGNATURE = "I EXPECT 'SAVE()' TO SPIT OUT AN SSERROR OR NIL & GIVE IT BACK TO ME FOR USE IN MY COMPLETION CLOSURE"
 completionHandler(saveProjects(projects))
 note how you only want to do something with the error it spits out if saving is unsuccessful
 --------------------------
 * 1st prob - kept looping between sending empty array as completion to not reading array at all (nil)
 > Kept saying CodingKey could not be found - this happened after I changed SSProject model's 'subTitle' prop to 'subtitle' so it read nil there on the fetch
 > I just used the defaults.removeObjectForKey... method to delete what was in the OG key & took it out
 > then I changed the keyname in my constants slightly to 'start fresh'
 > still ran into problems but I'm thinking it was in regards to the below as the error msgs changed
 * 2nd prob - kept getting nil when attempting to update diffable datasource
 > it's cause you had not yet called its config method in either the VDL or the VWAppear (either of which will work but now I prefer the VDL to keep it out of the logolauncher
 --------------------------
 * commitEditingStyle not responding to invocation of the insert button being tapped in edit mode. Why?
 > maybe it's becuase I'm using a Diffable datasource - this may not trigger the 'commitEditingStyle' method like a traditional data source would
 --------------------------
 * committal of editing style in HomeVC was not firing
 > I needed to subclass UITableViewDiffableDataSource & override the commit function after setting up a delegate of type 'HomeVC'
 > I needed to include both the 'canEdit..' and 'commit' methods in this custom class (see Managers > SSTableViewDiffableDataSource)
 class SSTableViewDiffableDataSource: UITableViewDiffableDataSource<Section, SSProject>

 HORNS-TO-TOOT::
 ðŸŽº Instead of creating only the first 8 projects from scratch to load into the tableview as Paul Hudson instructs, I've constructed a Project model that holds / loads a project's title, subtitle, index, and skillset to be decoded via an api call (see next horn)
 ðŸŽº Created a fully functional API for the hacking with swift website's project list page using Google's App Script to pull values from a spreadsheet I wrote myself
 > .. Allowing me to fetch the projects from a consistent source without having to create, store, update the datasource then save to the persistence manager every load for values that will never differ.
 ðŸŽº For the API call needing a bit of time before the user sees anything, I've converted the normal tableView into a custom DataLoadingViewController to show progress
 ðŸŽº Added a search feature using a diffable datasource, requiring me to make the SSProject model both hashable and codable
